        <h1><center>Your Occasion desrves our careful planning </center></h1>
        <p>Over demanding Clients: He/She thinks that his/ her event is the only event happening which will make history no event has happened and no event will happen after that. They might not have budget or space to host a huge event but always want an out of the box and new ideas to do same old things with similar practices. 
            Budget Crunches: Everyone needs big ideas, new ideas all the glitz and glamour but won't have money to shell out.They will want some third party to fund it. If no one than event manger should do it because the client has given him or her the opportunity to do this event in life.</p>
        <p>Timeline Crunches: Client will always knew that this event has to happen on that day but the decision on important things will keep on changing till last moment. I hope all of us agree to this:)
            Unrealistic Expectations: It's very simple you will get what you are spending for still client will have a wish list of unrealistic expectations last moment.
            Untrained Manpower: All promoters or event support manpower which comes to manage on site are generally freshers who will do some 6- 8 hours of job for pocket money and fun. Client will be expecting that they will be the brand ambassador which is highly unrealistic.
            Artist Tantrums: I don't think I need to write about it but they make you run for every single thing ( excluding some good Artist). They come from some other planet. At home they drink RO water and demands EVIAN, Travel by auto to places and ask for Luxury Cars. Redeem Jet miles to Convert Economy Class to Business Class & Charging for Business Class tickets from Client /Agency.</p>
        <p>Govt Norms / Taxes/ Noc/ Licences: Unrealistic categorization of services and high taxes. You will end up paying vendors and govt if you will go by book of law. It's not very clear. Harassment of some private agencies and forcing to acquire licences. Even Some 5 star properties who force you to acquire licences as they have a cut on revenue from the 3rd party licence providers.
            In house Team: It's a teamwork but you will find lot of people who join the band wagon for either attend parties, free drinks and food, some money and pictures with celebrities these are the most dangerous team mates because they will always have a casual attitude towards work. Choose them wisely and don't give them second chance for big mistakes. I can keep on writing about it but yes these are a few in day to day life of an event manager to earn bread n butter and fighting with his or her own skills for each event to be successful. 
            Eventfully Yours</p>
